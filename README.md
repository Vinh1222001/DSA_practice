DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

Current GNU version: 6.3.0

This git is use for me to practice algorithms

If you download this responsive to your computer and want to run something, make sure you installed mingw and it work normaly. Then folow steps below:

1 - Most of the folders in this responsive are independent projects except the Libs folder. It is my own libery I wrote for using in other project. If you want to try running a project, use need to go to it by command 

    cd <Project's name>

2 - After go to the project, you just use the command:
    
    make or mingw32-make

That's it!

Thank for your attention.

Have a nice day.
